	            <h3> When I was little, I always enjoyed solving problems, </h3>
	            <p>especially puzzles or math problems. I would spend a lot of my childhood always trying to conquer the next math safari adventure game. </p>
	            <p>I've always wanted to have a job that never seemed like it was a chore or work, but still have a valuable impact in the world. Luckily for me, that is what coding is to me. I get to solve puzzles all day long - and to top it off- making a living off of it! Unfortunately, this realization did not come to me until I was a junior attending the University of Iowa, while pursing my mathematics degree. I was beginning to resent math due to the abstractness and my failure to see the practicality of it. I needed something more concrete, and luckily, to my salvation, I was forced to take a computer science fundamentals course as part of my math degree requirements... and I fell in LOVE. What enticed me the most was that I am able to incorporate my math and problem solving skills into something practical! Ever since then my life has finally made sense, and <b>I knew that I wanted to become a developer. </b>
	            </p>	
	            <p> When I'm not at work or developing side projects on my own, I practice <b>yoga</b> as much as I can. I usually prefer hot or bikram yoga, but love trying different styles of yoga, such as ashtanga or acrobatic.  The mat is where I feel the most free and self aware, and it is where I can be the most honest with myself. A day or two without being on my mat hinders my connection with my self awareness. Someday I plan on becoming yoga alliance certified and be able to teach and share my love for yoga with my fellow yogis. Be sure to check out my yoga portfolio!
	            </p>
	            <p> When I'm not coding or on my mat, I love to explore new recipes. I'm a huge <b>foodie</b>, so I love giving my tastebuds a pleasurable and diverse experience as often as I can! I am still trying to master the art of cooking Vietnamese food, but since I have the best teacher I could ask for (my mom), I think there's a slight chance it could happen!
	            </p>
	            <br>

	            <p> Enough rambling about me...for now! If you would like to know more about me, feel free to contact me via any of my social media or email! I would love to hear from you! Namaste.</p>
